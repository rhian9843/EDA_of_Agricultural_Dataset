# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS OF AN AGRICULTURAL DATASET IN R

In order to better understand the intricate relationships affecting agricultural productivity, a large dataset comprising information on temperature, pesticide use, rainfall, and crop yield from
different locations is analyzed in this study. The study looks at regional variations, temporal trends, and the effects of environmental factors on crop productivity using statistical tools and
visualizations. Analysis of correlations is done to find connections between climate factors and
yield. The R programming language is used for the entire analysis, and the 'fitdistrplus' tool is used to find the distribution that best fits the yield data. The results emphasize how crucial it is to comprehend how agricultural productivity and climatic conditions are related.
